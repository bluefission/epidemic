					Consent as a Basis for Processing
						In some cases, we will ask for your consent to process your Personal Data. You may indicate your consent in a number of ways, including, as permitted by law, ticking a box (or equivalent action) to indicate your consent when (i) providing us with your Personal Data through our Services or a form (including enrolling in Promotions); or (ii) registering or creating an account with us. Due to different countries' laws governing consent for the collection and use of Personal Data, the requirements for consent will differ across regions. We may request your consent for a number of activities including:

					Collecting Mobile Device IDs, Advertising IDs, and Data from Sensors. 
						When you use our mobile apps we may ask for your consent to collect these (this consent may be captured at the operating system level). To change your consent status for this data please go to the preferences of the specific service or app. If you choose not to provide this information, certain Services features may be unavailable or not function properly.

					Processing Sensitive Personal Data. 
						We may request your consent to process sensitive Personal Data. Certain Websites or Mobile Apps may require this data to provide the Services, including when you use or interact with a wearable or other connected device, and when you take fitness tests or assessments. If you choose not to provide sensitive Personal Data (for example, specific kinds of Fitness and Wellness Data), certain features or Services may be unavailable or not function properly.

					Collecting and Sharing Location Data. 
						We may request your consent to collect your precise Location Data. Our Services may require this data to provide the Services. If you choose not to provide this information, certain Services features may be unavailable or not function properly. Location Data may be used to display your live location and movement.

					Research. 
						We may request your consent to use your Personal Data for Research purposes. We may also request your consent to contact you to determine your interest to participate in certain Research initiatives and to share identifying results. For market research, we may ask questions on behalf of business partners and share your response with business partners.

					Transfer of Data. 
						We transfer data to the United States and to other countries/regions for processing. We may request your consent for this transfer or the transfer, in other cases, may be justified by a legal basis other than consent.

					Automated Processing. 
						We may use some automated processing to provide our Services and to make recommendations in the context of specific services. This processing is strictly necessary for providing certain Services (and, in some cases, is the service itself) and is not covered by consent. Other automated processing is not significant either due to the nature of the data or the decisions being made or recommended, and so consent is not required. However, for automated processing that is significant and related to sensitive Personal Data, prior to sharing or using such data, we will first seek your consent.

					To Enable Social Sharing and Connect with Us on Social Media. 
						Some of our services consist of social sharing and communication with others. If you sign up for these services, we may ask for your consent to use your information to enable sharing as described in the service.

						We may also ask for your consent when you connect with us through Social Media.

					<h2>Social Sharing Settings</h2>
					Within our Services there are four sharing settings: Private, Share for Research, and Public. Our platform is designed for your wellness and fitness benefit. As such, you are able to control what Personal Data you share and with whom you share it. We encourage you to adjust the sharing settings to best meet your objectives and sharing comfort level. In the interest of safeguarding your Personal Data, we have outlined some initial default sharing settings.

					<h3>Default Sharing Settings</h3>

					-"Physical Stats" are set as Private. "Private" means not shared with friends or other members. You can change this default status for some of your physical stats. Information that is "Private" by default includes, for example, your height, weight, BMI, and heart rate.
					-"Activity Stats" are set as Share with Friends. "Share for Research" means visible to your friends, but not shared with other members. You can change this default status if you want. Information that is set as "Share for Research" by default includes, for example, symptoms and locations.
					-Lookup Information is set as Public. We believe that social motivation helps encourage participcation in citizen science allowing your friends to be able to find you is crucial to this experience. Therefore, your first and last name, location, gender, username, main fitness activity, and profile picture are set as Public. If you set your entire account as Private, your lookup data will no longer be available for your friends to find you (unless you otherwise indicate that desire within the Services).
					
					<h3>Changing Your Sharing Preferences</h3>

					Details on how to update your sharing preferences and the default settings for our Services are outlined within the sharing standard.

					Note: When you share information from our Services externally with a SNS, the information you post is governed by their privacy policy and settings.

					<h2>Managing Preferences and Withdrawing Consent</h2>
					You may at any time withdraw your consent with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other controls regarding website and online data collection, your communication settings, and app preferences. Depending on the Service, collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to work.

					We provide you several ways to manage your preferences:

					Cookie Use and Controls 
						Cookies serve a wide variety of purposes. Cookies are pieces of data stored in your web browser that are transmitted to websites to remember your browser over time and distinguish it from other users. Cookies are used to personalize your web experience, for security, and analytics. Our cookies are placed and read by our web servers. You can block and control cookies using the information noted in this section. If you block all cookies, certain functionality on our website will not work.
						
						One way to think about cookies is based on their function. The following settings will control our use of browser cookies, the use of IP address for tracking, and the collection and use of data.

						[ IN ] Required Cookies. These strictly necessary cookies are used for core functionality, and recognize when you are signed in, remember things such as shopping carts and text entered, are necessary for security, and enforce your privacy preferences. Without these cookies, some functionality on our websites will fail. You can block these cookies in your browser preferences.
						[ IN / OUT ] Functional Cookies. These cookies help to improve the sites by allowing us to understand how the site is used and how the site performs. These cookies include analytics and measurement.

					IP Address Use 
						An IP address refers to an identifier assigned by a network to a computer, mobile device, Internet of Things (IoT) device, or routing device. IP addresses, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, include "public" IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that is visible to the Internet, as well as "local" IP addresses, which are IP addresses assigned to computers and mobile devices "behind" a router (such as a home router). We may use IP addresses for security purposes and verification of legitmate activity.

						You can choose not to have IP address used for purposes of analytics by using the cookie controls for "Performance/Analytics," above.

					Web Pixels or Beacons Use
						Pixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web browser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party corresponding to the pixel. If that party's cookies are currently stored in your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request. Beacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the opening of a marketing email. When used in conjunction with cookies for interest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to control the purpose for which they are used.

					HTML5 Local Storage 
						HTML5 Local Storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be used for the same purpose (to pair a tracking ID to a particular web server with your web browser so that the web server can identify your web browser over time). You can control the purpose for which HTML5 Local Storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above.

					Flash Cookie Use 
						Flash cookies are "local shared objects" used by Flash player to store data, similar to cookies. Although Flash content is declining in use, we may still use Flash on our sites. If you have Flash installed, and wish to delete, block, or manage Flash cookies, please use the Flash settings panel made available by Adobe.

					Social Network Interaction and Widgets 
						Flash cookies are "local shared objects" used by Flash player to store data, similar to cookies. Although Flash content is declining in use, we may still use Flash on our sites. If you have Flash installed, and wish to delete, block, or manage Flash cookies, please use the Flash settings panel made available by Adobe.

					Mobile Device Advertising IDs, Location, Sensor Data, and In-Range Device Data Use 
						Our mobile apps and our Services may transmit Device IDs, Location Data, and data from sensors to us and our partners.

						Device IDs include IDs associated with your mobile device carrier such as IMEI, MEID, IMSI; platform-specific IDs such as Android ID, Google AID, and Apple's IDFA; and IDs that are part of your device hardware, such as WiFi MAC address, and serial number. Exactly which Device IDs are transmitted can depend on your mobile device platform and the version of your operating system.

						Location Data. Our apps and Services transmit precise Location Data. Location Data may be obtained from GPS services, cell tower triangulation, or known location of nearby WiFi access points.

						Sensor and In-Range Device Data. Our apps and Services may also collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSIDs) from other, in-range or networked devices and WiFi Access Points. Our apps and Services may also collect information about altitude, air pressure, change in position.

						How We Use Mobile Device Data. We may use Device IDs, coarse location and Location Data, and data from sensors, including the local network, (together with app usage data and Fitness and Wellness Data) for strictly necessary purposes; improving our apps and analytics; and personalization and preferences.

					Withdraw Your Consent for Use of Your Mobile Device IDs and Location Data for Analytics
						To the extent our mobile apps personalize functionality for you, you can change these settings within the app, or reset to defaults by deleting and reinstalling the app.

					Other Ways to Manage Your Location Services 
						You can also turn off the transmission of precise Location Data by turning off those services using your mobile device's built-in settings. Turning off location may cause some of our Services not to work.
					 
					Change Consent Settings for Communication Preferences 
						Consent for Email Communication: After signing up for email communications, you can choose to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link in any email we send. If you use more than one Service, then unsubscribing from the emails relating to that Service will not stop you from receiving emails from other Services. Please note that if you unsubscribe from "all emails" this means "all emails other than strictly necessary emails." You will still receive email communications from us if they are strictly necessary to provide the service or to confirm or validate a transaction, recover accounts, etc.
						
						Opt-In Mobile Text Messages: You can opt-in to receive notification text messages. Text messages are auto-dialed and consent to text messages is not required for any purchase or service. You can opt-out of marketing by sending STOP to the number following the directions sent back to you when you sign up.

						Mobile Push Notifications: You can manage the type of push notifications you receive from us by modifying the settings within the Service. For more information on how to update your push notification settings for our Services please visit here. You may also set your mobile device settings to not allow push notifications from us.
