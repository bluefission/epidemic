					If you choose to subscribe to any of our enhanced, paid services, these are the payment and billing terms that apply. Paid services and billing may auto-renew unless you cancel. You may cancel at any time.
					7.1 Payment Terms
					We offer certain premium versions of the Services (the “Premium Services”) for a fee. By signing up for and using the Premium Services, you agree to our Terms, and any additional terms and conditions provided here. You also agree to waive your 14-day right of withdrawal at the moment you subscribe to the Premium Services to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, so that you are able to immediately access them.

					The Premium Services provide you access to certain enhanced products, services, features and functionality (e.g., premium graphs and analysis, an ad-free browsing experience). By signing up for and using the Premium Services, including signing up for Free Trials of the Premium Services, you agree to pay any fees or other incurred charges that apply to the Premium Services (such as subscription fees).

					When you sign up for the Premium Services, you must designate and provide information about your preferred payment method (“Payment Method”). This information must be complete and accurate, and you are responsible for keeping it up to date. You expressly authorize us to collect via automatic debit or ACH from your Payment Method the appropriate fees charged for the Premium Services and for any other purchases you elect to make via the Services.

					You can choose to pay for the Premium Services on a monthly or annual basis. Unless otherwise stated, all fees due for the Premium Services are payable in advance, and will be billed automatically to the Payment Method at the start of the monthly or annual Premium Service period, as applicable. Unless otherwise stated, Premium Services will auto-renew until you elect to cancel your access to Premium Services. All purchases of Premium Services are final and non-refundable, except at our sole discretion and in accordance with the rules governing each Premium Service.

					7.2 Termination or Cancellation of Premium Services
					If you do not pay the fees or charges due for your use of the Premium Services, we may make reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate your access to the Premium Services (and may do so without notice).

					You can cancel the Premium Services at any time. More information on how to cancel can be found here. Once you have cancelled your Premium Service and received confirmation, no other changes can be made to your account. The cancellation of a Premium Service will go into effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will have the same level of access to the Premium Service through the remainder of such billing cycle. For example, if you are billed on a monthly basis and cancel during a given month, you will be charged for the entirety of that month and maintain access to the Premium Service through the end of that month.

					There are no refunds for termination or cancellation of your Premium Service. If you no longer wish to subscribe to a Premium Service, it is your responsibility to cancel your Premium Service in due time, regardless of whether or not you actively use the Premium Service.

					7.3 Fee Changes
					To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change our prices for Premium Services at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable Premium Service and/or by sending you an email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices, you can cancel the applicable Premium Service prior to the change going into effect.

					7.4 Discount, Coupon or Gift Codes
					If you have received a discount, coupon or gift code to a Premium Service, the following terms and conditions apply in addition to the terms and conditions of the specific code. To redeem a discount or coupon code, log in to the applicable Service and enter the applicable code to take advantage of the relevant promotion. All discounts, gift and coupon codes can only be applied when subscribing to Premium Services, and to accounts not already subscribed to Premium Services. Discount, coupon and gift codes cannot be combined with any other cash-off price, sales, promotion or coupon, and cannot be exchanged, refunded, replaced or redeemed for cash or payment of accounts. A payment method may be required to redeem a discount or coupon code. It is your own responsibility to use a discount, coupon or gift code before it expires, and expired codes cannot be refunded or extended. It is also your responsibility to terminate the Premium Service before the end of a free or discounted period if you do not want to continue with a Premium Service at the regular price. The terms and conditions of a specific discount, coupon or gift code may include additional restrictions on its use, including but not limited to the type of plan, duration of free or discounted Premium Service, coupon validity dates, and/or purchase quantities. Under Armour reserves the right to cancel discounts and coupon promotions at any time.

					7.5 Free Trials
					We sometimes offer free trials of our Premium Services or other promotional offers (each a “Free Trial”). A Free Trial provides you access to the Premium Services for a period of time, with details specified when you sign up for the offer.

					In order to sign up for a Free Trial, you may need to provide us with your preferred Payment Method. As soon as you submit your payment details, your Free Trial will begin. You will not be charged until the Free Trial period ends.

					Unless you cancel before the end of the Free Trial, or unless otherwise stated, your access to the Premium Service will automatically continue and you will be billed the applicable fees for that Premium Service using the Payment Method you provided. All incurred charges are final and non-refundable, except at our sole discretion and in accordance with the rules governing each Premium Service. We may send you a reminder when your Free Trial is about to end, but we do not guarantee any such notifications. It is ultimately your responsibility to know when the Free Trial will end if you decide you do not want to become a paying Premium Services user after the Free Trial period.

					If you decide you do not want to become a paying Premium Services user, you must cancel your subscription before the end of the Free Trial period. Depending on the applicable Premium Service, you may lose access as soon as you cancel or at the end of the Free Trial period. Once you have cancelled your Free Trial and received confirmation, you cannot resume the Free Trial period even if it was not used for the entire duration of the offer.

					Premium Service features and content may change at any time, and we cannot guarantee any specific feature or content will be available for the entire Free Trial period. The rates in effect when you sign up for the Free Trial will be the same when the Free Trial ends, unless we notify you otherwise. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to modify or terminate any Free Trial offer, your access to the Premium Services during the Free Trial, or any of these terms without notice and with no liability. You may not sign up for more than one Free Trial of a given Premium Service at the same time, and we reserve the right to limit your ability to take advantage of multiple Free Trials.
